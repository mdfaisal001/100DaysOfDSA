# Day 1: Arrays

In this first day of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**, I focused on fundamental problems related to arrays. The goal was to strengthen my understanding of array manipulation techniques and familiarize myself with common problem-solving patterns.

## üìã Problems Solved

### 1. Find the Maximum Element in an Array

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers, find and return the maximum element.
- **Approach**: 
  - Initialize a variable to store the maximum value.
  - Iterate through the array, updating the maximum value whenever a larger element is found.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### 2. Second Largest Element in the Array

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers, find and return the second largest element.
- **Approach**: 
  - Initialize two variables to keep track of the largest and second largest elements.
  - Traverse the array, updating these variables accordingly.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## üíª Code Implementations

- **Find Maximum Element**: [max_element.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day1/maxElement.cpp)
- **Second Largest Element**: [second_largest.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day1/SecondLargestElement.cpp)

## üìù Learnings

- I learned about efficient ways to iterate through arrays and the importance of keeping track of multiple variables to find solutions.
- This exercise helped reinforce the concept of linear time complexity and its implications in algorithm efficiency.

# Day 2: Missing Number in Array and Array Reverse

On the second day of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**, I delved into two significant problems involving arrays: **Finding the Missing Number in an Array** and **Reversing an Array**. These exercises reinforced my understanding of array manipulation and explored different algorithmic approaches.

## üìã Problems Solved

### 1. Missing Number in Array

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0` to `n`, find and return the one number that is missing from the array.
- **Approach**: 
  - Calculate the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers and subtract the actual sum of the array elements to identify the missing number.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### 2. Array Reverse

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array, reverse its elements in place.
- **Approach**: 
  - Use a two-pointer technique to swap elements from the beginning and end of the array until they meet in the middle.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## üíª Code Implementations

- **Missing Number in Array**: [missing_number.cpp]()
- **Array Reverse**: [array_reverse.cpp](./Day2/array_reverse.cpp)

## üìù Learnings

- I learned about different techniques for solving the missing number problem, emphasizing the importance of selecting efficient algorithms based on time complexity.
- The exercise reinforced my skills in array manipulation, specifically in reversing arrays using various approaches.
