# Day 16: Reverse String

On the sixteenth day of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**, I tackled the "Reverse String" problem using recursion, a fundamental technique that is highly applicable to a wide range of problems.

## üìã Problems Solved

### 1. Reverse String

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array of characters, reverse the array in place using recursion.

### Approach:

#### Recursive Approach
- **Approach**:
  - I created a helper function `reverseHelper` that uses recursion to swap characters from both ends of the array towards the center.
  - The base case is when the `firstIndex` is greater than or equal to the `lastIndex`.
  - The helper function is then called recursively to continue reversing the remaining characters.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the recursion stack.

## üíª Code Implementation

- **Recursive Solution**: [reverse_string_recursive.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day16/stringReversalRecursion.cpp)

## üìù Learnings

- This problem helped me understand how recursion can simplify solutions, making it easier to write clear and concise code.
- While iterating solutions may seem easier at first glance, recursion offers an alternative approach that is useful in many algorithmic problems.

# Day 17: Subsequences of a String

On the seventeenth day of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**, I explored how to generate all possible subsequences of a given string. This problem emphasizes the concept of subsets, binary representation, and recursion.

## üìã Problems Solved

### 1. Subsequences of a String

- **Problem Statement**: Given a string, generate all possible subsequences (non-contiguous subsequences) of the string.

### Approach:

#### 1. Recursive Approach
- **Approach**:
  - I used a helper function `subseqHelper` to recursively generate subsequences.
  - At each index, we have two choices: either include the current character in the subsequence or exclude it.
  - Base case: when the index reaches the length of the string, we store the current subsequence (if it's not empty).
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), where `n` is the length of the string, as we explore two possibilities at each step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), considering the recursion stack.

#### 2. Iterative (Bitmasking) Approach
- **Approach**:
  - The bitmasking approach treats the problem as a subset generation problem. For a string of size `n`, there are `2^n` subsequences.
  - Each number from `1` to `2^n - 1` is treated as a bitmask. For each bit set, we include the corresponding character from the string.
  - This avoids recursion and uses binary representation to generate subsequences.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * 2^n), as we generate `2^n` subsequences, and for each subsequence, we iterate over the characters.
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^n), required to store all subsequences.

## üíª Code Implementation

- **Recursive Solution**: [subsequences_recursive.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day17/subsequenceOfString.cpp)
- **Bitmasking Solution**: [subsequences_bitmask.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day17/subsequenceOfString.cpp)

## üìù Learnings

- This problem helped me understand the recursive generation of subsequences, a concept closely related to solving problems using backtracking.
- The bitmasking approach allowed me to explore a non-recursive, more systematic way of generating subsequences by leveraging binary numbers.
- Both approaches showcase different ways to solve the same problem, emphasizing the flexibility of algorithm design.

# Day 18,19,20: Combination Sum I,II,III

On the eighteenth day of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**, I worked on the "Combination Sum" problem. This problem is great for practicing recursion and backtracking.

## üìã Problems Solved

### 1. Combination Sum

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum up to `target`. The same number may be chosen an unlimited number of times.

### Approach:

#### Recursive Backtracking Approach
- **Approach**:
  - I used a helper function `findCombinationSum` to recursively explore all possible combinations of numbers that sum up to the target.
  - At each index, there are two choices: include the current element if it is less than or equal to the target, or move to the next element without including it.
  - When the target reaches zero, the current combination is added to the result.
  - Backtracking is used to remove the last added element and explore other combinations.
  
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^t), where `t` is the target value, as there are multiple ways to reach the target.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where `k` is the number of elements in a single combination.

## üíª Code Implementation

- **Combination Sum I Solution**: [combination_sum.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day18/comminationSum.cpp)
- - **Combination Sum II Solution**: [combination_sum.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day18/comminationSum.cpp)
  - - **Combination Sum III Solution**: [combination_sum.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day18/comminationSum.cpp)

## üìù Learnings

- This problem deepened my understanding of recursive backtracking, which is crucial for solving problems that involve exploring different combinations or permutations.
- I learned how to handle problems with repetitive choices where the same element can be reused multiple times in a solution.
- The use of backtracking to explore all possible combinations, and removing the last added element after exploring a path, is a key technique in this type of problem.

Looking forward to continuing this challenge and working on more complex recursive problems in the upcoming days!
