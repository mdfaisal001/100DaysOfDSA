# Day 4: Separate Negative and Positive Numbers in an Array

On the fourth day of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**, I focused on solving the problem of separating negative and positive numbers in an array. I utilized the two-pointer technique to achieve the desired result in optimal time.

## üìã Problems Solved

### 1. Separate Negative and Positive Numbers in an Array

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers, rearrange the array such that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers. The relative order of negative numbers and positive numbers does not matter.
- **Approach**:
  - Use two pointers: one at the start and one at the end of the array.
  - Iterate through the array, and if the start pointer points to a positive number and the end pointer points to a negative number, swap them.
  - Repeat this process until the pointers cross each other.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use constant space for two pointers.

## üíª Code Implementations

- **Separate Negative and Positive Numbers**: [separate_neg_pos.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day4/sepNegAndPos.cpp)

## üìù Learnings

- The two-pointer technique is a powerful tool for efficiently solving problems related to partitioning arrays.
- This problem helped reinforce my understanding of in-place algorithms and constant space optimizations.
- It was a practical exercise in manipulating array indices and swapping values.

# Day 5: Cyclically Rotate an Array

On the fifth day of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**, I worked on solving the problem of cyclically rotating an array. I implemented multiple approaches to better understand different techniques for array manipulation.

## üìã Problems Solved

### 1. Cyclically Rotate an Array

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array, cyclically rotate the array by one position. This means moving the last element of the array to the first position.
- **Approach 1 (Swap-based with Two-Pointer)**:
  - Use two pointers: one at the start of the array and the other at the last element.
  - Swap elements until all positions are rotated.
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
  - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is used apart from the pointers.
  
- **Approach 2 (Shift-based)**:
  - Store the last element of the array in a temporary variable.
  - Shift all other elements to the right by one position.
  - Place the temporary last element at the first position.
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we iterate through the array once.
  - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is used other than the temporary variable.

## üíª Code Implementations

- **Cyclically Rotate an Array (Two-Pointer)**: [https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day5/circularRotateArr.cpp)
- **Cyclically Rotate an Array (Shift-based)**: [https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day5/circularRotateArr.cpp)

## üìù Learnings

# Day 6: Intersection of Two Arrays

On the sixth day of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**, I focused on solving the "Intersection of Two Arrays" problem using three different approaches. Each approach helped me understand different trade-offs in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and code efficiency.

## üìã Problems Solved

### 1. Intersection of Two Arrays

- **Problem Statement**: Given two arrays, return the intersection of these arrays. Each element in the result must be unique.
  
### Approaches:
  
#### a. Brute-Force Approach
- **Approach**: Compare each element of the first array with each element of the second array using nested loops.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤) due to the nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used.
  
#### b. Optimized Two-Pointer Approach
- **Approach**: 
  - First, sort both arrays.
  - Use two pointers to traverse both arrays simultaneously, checking for common elements.
  - Move the pointer in the smaller array forward to continue the comparison.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting and O(n) for traversing.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space beyond the input arrays is used.
  
#### c. Hash Set Approach
- **Approach**: 
  - Store the elements of the first array in an unordered set.
  - Traverse the second array and check for common elements in the set.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) on average, as hash set operations (insert and lookup) are constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the storage of elements in the hash set.

## üíª Code Implementations

- **Brute-Force Approach**: [intersection_brute_force.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day6/intersectionOf2Array.cpp)
- **Two-Pointer Approach**: [intersection_two_pointer.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day6/intersectionOf2Array.cpp)
- **Hash Set Approach**: [intersection_hash_set.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day6/intersectionOf2Array.cpp)

## üìù Learnings

- The brute-force approach, though easy to implement, is inefficient for large arrays due to its O(n¬≤) time complexity.
- The two-pointer technique provided a more optimized solution with O(n log n) complexity, and its in-place nature minimized the space usage.
- The hash set approach introduced me to a faster solution with O(n) time complexity, helping me understand the practical application of hash tables in solving intersection problems.
- Today, I also learned about the trade-offs between space and time complexity when choosing between different approaches.
