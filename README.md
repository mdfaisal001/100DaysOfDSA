This repository is organized into daily folders, each containing:

- **Problem Statements**: A brief description of the problem being solved.
- **Code**: The implemented solution in C++.


# Day 1: Arrays

In this first day of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**, I focused on fundamental problems related to arrays. The goal was to strengthen my understanding of array manipulation techniques and familiarize myself with common problem-solving patterns.

## üìã Problems Solved

### 1. Find the Maximum Element in an Array

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers, find and return the maximum element.
- **Approach**: 
  - Initialize a variable to store the maximum value.
  - Iterate through the array, updating the maximum value whenever a larger element is found.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### 2. Second Largest Element in the Array

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers, find and return the second largest element.
- **Approach**: 
  - Initialize two variables to keep track of the largest and second largest elements.
  - Traverse the array, updating these variables accordingly.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## üíª Code Implementations

- **Find Maximum Element**: [max_element.cpp](https://github.com/mdfaisal001/100DaysOfDSA/blob/main/100DaysOfDSA/Day1/maxElement.cpp)
- **Second Largest Element**: [second_largest.cpp](./Day1/second_largest.cpp)

## üìù Learnings

- I learned about efficient ways to iterate through arrays and the importance of keeping track of multiple variables to find solutions.
- This exercise helped reinforce the concept of linear time complexity and its implications in algorithm efficiency.
